# NN-from-scratch
This is the code for a fully connected neural network. The code is written from scratch using Numpy, without using any ready-made deep learning library. In this, classification is done on the MNIST dataset. It is generalized to include various options for activation functions, loss functions, types of regularization, and output activation types.
